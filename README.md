# Image-Processor
Image Processing application using Matlab for Semester 5 Image Processing module

Simple application using Matlab which has following functionalities
  1)Convert images to Gray scale with 8bpp format
  2)Re-sample each image at 25% scale using bi-linear interpolation methods.  
  Then up-sample each down-sampled image back to their original size using nearest-neighbor method
  
  3)Compare the original image and re-sampled images and find the average and standard deviation of distortion 
  in the sample process.
  
  4)Take the original gray-scale image and compress them into the following algorithm
  Entropy coding, Bit-plane based run-length coding
  
  5)Un-compress the each compressed image using respective un-compress algorithms
